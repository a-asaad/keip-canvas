# Feature Roadmap

- [ ] One button deployment of flow diagrams to Kubernetes clusters running [keip](https://github.com/codice/keip).
- [ ] Multiplayer support: allow several users to collaborate on a diagram in real-time.
- [ ] Reusable flows: define reusable patterns by encapsulating a set of nodes into a subflow, which can then be exported and integrated into other diagrams.
